<h2> <u>Buttermilk Oven Fried Chicken</u></h2>
    <p>
        chicken is a quintessential summertime picnic food, but when the colder months around we still crave the crispy goodness of fried chicken. What we don't love are the calories! This oven baked "fried" chicken recipe comes out super crisp yet without all the added fat of a traditional deep-fried chicken. The trick to creating a nice crust on both sides of the chicken is to preheat the oven with a cookie sheet inside - getting that cookie sheet nice and hot! When you are ready to put the chicken in the oven, there will already be a heated surface to crisp the bottom side of the chicken.
